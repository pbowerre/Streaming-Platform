## Project Description

This project provides a dynamic UI for a movie streaming platform, simulating a Netflix-style home screen with different sections like recent movies, promotional banners, and navigation options. It includes skeleton loading animations to enhance user experience during data fetching. Designed with a component-based structure in **React** and **TypeScript**, this project is easily maintainable and scalable.

## Demo

## Features

- **Responsive Header**: Includes navigation links and a search bar.
- **Banner Section**: Displays the featured movie with a play button.
- **Movie Cards Section**: Shows recent movies with images and titles.
- **Skeleton Loading**: Renders loading placeholders while fetching data.
- **Modular Components**: Each UI section is encapsulated within a component.
- **API Fetching**: Ready for integration with a movie API to display dynamic data.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and improved development experience.
- **CSS**: For styling components and creating a responsive design.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-streaming-platform-ui.git
   cd movie-streaming-platform-ui
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Application**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

1. **Header Navigation**: Navigate through different sections.
2. **Banner Section**: Displays a featured movie with an option to play.
3. **Movie Cards**: Shows recent movies with images and titles.
4. **Skeleton Loading**: Displays placeholders until the movie data is fetched.

Replace the static data in `App.tsx` with actual API calls for real-time data.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a modular structure for easy scalability:

```plaintext
src/
│
├── components/
│   ├── Header/           # Header component with navigation links and search bar
│   ├── Banner/           # Banner component displaying the featured movie
│   ├── MovieCards/       # Movie cards and skeleton loader components
│   └── Button/           # Reusable button component
│
└── App.tsx               # Main component to combine all sections
```

## Component Overview

### 1. `Header`

The `Header` component includes a navigation menu with links to various sections of the platform. It also features a search bar and a profile icon for user interactions.

### 2. `Banner`

The `Banner` component highlights a featured movie, displaying its title, rating, and a "Play" button. It includes an additional button for actions like adding to a watchlist.

### 3. `MovieCard` and `SkeletonLoader`

- **MovieCard**: Displays individual movies with a poster image and title.
- **SkeletonLoader**: A loading animation to display placeholders while movie data is fetched from the API.

### 4. `Button`

A reusable button component with customizable styles for different actions, such as "Play" or "Add to Watchlist".

## API Integration

To replace the static data with dynamic data from an API:

1. Replace the sample data in `App.tsx` with an API call.
2. Use a service like [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) or any other movie API of your choice.

Example API call with `fetch`:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('https://api.example.com/movies')
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      setMovies(data);
      setLoading(false);
    })
    .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
}, []);
```
